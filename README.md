# Craps-Simulation
Simulate and record the lengths of 200 games of craps using numbers from random.org for AP Stats probability unit project

A large quantity of integers distributed uniformly from 1-6 were pregenerated to simulate individual dice rolls, located in the input&output folder

The main.py program iterates through pairs of those random integers, using their sums to simulate craps games.
